### What is Alibaba Cloud Kernel

Alibaba Cloud Kernel(a.k.a. the “Cloud Kernel”), a customized and optimized version of Linux kernel, is originated by Alibaba Operating System Team (formerly known as Taobao Kernel Team). Cloud Kernel is installed as the default kernel in Alibaba Cloud Linux OS version 2 (or Aliyun Linux 2), which is running on Alibaba Cloud Elastic Compute Service (ECS) product. In Cloud Kernel, several features and enhancements adapted to specific Alibaba Cloud infrastructre and products have been made to help Alibaba Cloud customers to achieve better user experiences.

Like many other kernels, Cloud Kernel should work with almost all commonly-used Linux distributions, however, we highly recommend you run it in Alibaba Cloud Linux OS with Alibaba Cloud ECS instances to get best functionality, performance and stability.
